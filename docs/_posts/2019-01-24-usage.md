Once `mcl` is booted you may SSH inot it using your favorite SSH client.

## Running Containers

To run a Container using [Docker](https://www.docker.com):

```#!bash
$ docker run -d -p 8000:8000 prologic/hello-go
```

## Cloudinit

.. TODO: Document me.

## Persistence

`mcl` comes with support for persistant storage. Currently this is used for the
Docker Container runtime and is used to persist Docker Engine state, volumes
and configuration.

The bootup process looks for a Block Storage device labelled with `DOCKER_DATA`

Here are the basic steps using the provided Userspace:

```#!bash
$ echo -e "o\nn\np\n1\n\n\nw" | fdisk /dev/sda
$ mkfs.ext2 -L DOCKER_DATA /dev/sda1
$ reboot -f
```
